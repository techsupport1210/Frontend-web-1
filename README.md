I want to build a video sharing platform that's better than youtube and its competitors. It will allow content creators to upload videos and earn money from ads and the platform subscribers. A content creator will register to the platform, upload videos. The platform will have a search and discovery system to help users find videos. Subscribers will register to the platform and pay a monthly fee to once they decide to subsribe to content creator's chanel on the platform. The subscribers will be given benefits based on the subscription tier they choose.

Subscribers subscription packages:

- Basic: 25p/month
- Premium: 50p/month
- Elite: £1/month

The platform of will take 25% of the revenue generated from the platform subscribers. The remaining 75% revenue will be split between the platform content creators based on this Engagement-Based Distribution tier system:

- Top Tier (10% of content creators): 60% of platform's creator revenue shared between the top 10% of content creators
- Mid Tier (30% of content creators): 30% of platform's creator revenue shared between the next 30% of content creators
- Entry Tier (60% of content creators): 10% of platform's creator revenue shared between the remaining 60% of content creators
